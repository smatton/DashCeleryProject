 You can start workers by sourcing the python environment and running the following
 command from the project directory.

 "celery -A mytasks worker --loglevel=info"

 add --concurrency [n] to change the number of worker processes, -Q [queuename] designates the queue to listen to
 -P eventlet may be needed on windows workers, -f can specify location to write log file

 Example for Windows worker

 celery -A mytasks worker --loglevel=info --concurrency 7 -P eventlet -Q windowsWorker -f C:\Users\scott\Desktop\forSas\DashCeleryProject\logs\window_worker.log

 this  starts a worker registering the tasks in mytasks.py with 7 processes using eventlet to handle processes and listens
 on the "windowsWorker" queue logging to the file C:\Users\scott\Desktop\forSas\DashCeleryProject\logs\window_worker.logs
